                    <p>Linda is believes in teamwork, that it is a better way to learn new things from others, 
                        and know yourself better, and the diversity of characters makes the work complete 
                        in no time. I find history of things and how things work very fascinating, that is why I
                        joined computer science in highschool to learn about the computers how they work
                        and their evolution over time. Most of all I like create using my imagination
                        and creativity and as time goes by I grew passionate about DESIGN. I have finished highschool
                        in 2018, I am now doing my bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

                        As I grow I find many things that I like doing some of then is spending time,
                        with my friends. I also like exploring things, places and most of all I spend 
                        a lot of time learning about our history as humans why we do the things we do,
                        making research of the past and the future.
